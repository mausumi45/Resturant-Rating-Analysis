𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗲𝘀:

⭐ We found that the average rating for food experience in our dataset was around 1.21/2.00. This indicates that overall, customers were pleased with their dining experiences. But some restaurants didn't receive good ratings for the service. So the restaurants should focus on improving their service experience.

⭐ Most of the good restaurants are in the city of San Luis Potosi for which outsiders were travelling to this city. We can improve our food & services in other cities as well.

⭐ American cuisine is the second most preferred cuisine by customers but we don't have that many restaurants with american cuisine. We can improve the business in that segment as well.

⭐ Students & teenagers are more into drinking & smoking so we can plan some marketing strategy for them like special student entry or student discount to acquire customers.
